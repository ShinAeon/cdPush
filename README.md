# cdPush

A simple Flask API, run from PythonAnywhere.
It uses Twilio to send random challenge notifications via SMS once a week.

## Motivation
I was doing a daily push-up routine and wanted to add fully randomized challenge days once a week.
It would be fun if I had the notification waiting for me when I woke up and looked at my phone, so I decided on SMS.
